TESTING FRONT END STEPS:
1. Clone the repo (if you haven’t already)

git clone https://github.com/30percentother/3390Project3.git
cd 3390Project3.git/View/global-chat-app

2. Install the dependencies

npm install

3. Start the frontend locally

npm run dev

Then go to: http://localhost:5173

You’ll see the working global chat app with test messages.

Notes:
No backend is required yet — this uses fake data so you can test the layout

Once the backend is ready, we’ll connect it with Axios (getMessages, addMessage)
